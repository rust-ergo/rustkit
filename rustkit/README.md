# Ergo RustKit

### Introduction

A SDK for building applications on the Ergo blockchain. Our goal is to create a library that creates a simple and easy to use interface for developers to build applications. Currently, the library is in the early stages of development and is not recommended for production use.

### Setup

The Ergo RustKit is published on [crates.io](https://crates.io/). The crate can be found [here](https://crates.io/crates/ergo-rustkit).

```
ergo-rustkit = "0.5.0"
```

### Examples

A directory with multiple examples can be found [here](https://github.com/rust-ergo/rustkit/tree/master/examples).

Examples will be updated as the library is updated.

### Contributing

Rust-Ergo is always open for contributions! If you would like to contribute, please open a PR and we will review it as soon as possible.
