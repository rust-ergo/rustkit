# Ergo RustKit

### Introduction

A SDK for building applications on the Ergo blockchain. Our goal is to create a library that creates a simple and easy to use interface for developers to build applications. Currently, the library is in the early stages of development and is not recommended for production use. The full roadmap can be found below!

### Setup

The Ergo RustKit is published on [crates.io](https://crates.io/). The crate can be found [here](https://crates.io/crates/ergo-rustkit).

```
ergo-rustkit = "0.3.1"
```

### Tutorials

A seperate repo for tutorials can be found [here](https://github.com/rust-ergo/rustkit-tutorials).

Tutorials will be updated as the library is updated.
